Pitch:
I bring 8 years of software development expertise to the table, specializing in building in-house ERP applications 
using the .NET suite. Over the past two years, I've honed my skills in integrations and automations with third-party tools, 
employing technologies such as VB.NET, C#, SQL, .NET Framework, .NET Core, SQL Server, SSIS, SSRS, Talend ETL, and PowerShell 
scripts. Currently, I'm dedicated to advancing my web development skills through ASP.NET and React.
Beyond my professional life, I am a devoted husband and father to two boys aged 4 and 1. Remote work has allowed me to cherish 
more time with my family, but as my eldest approaches school age, I am seeking new career opportunities that offer a stable 
living environment for us. I am eager to bring my expertise to a team that values innovation and work-life balance, while also 
providing opportunities for personal and professional growth.
