Overview:
I want to make a personal profile web application to hone my skill in software development and be able to showcase my skills through the platform.

Goals:
- Only Microsoft : I want to just be in the Microsoft niche so I want to go through the whole architecture of using Microsoft products

Tech Stack:
    Following list is a starting point for things to set up.
    - Frontend: Blazor
        Optional: 
            - See what ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages offers and can ehance the app
            - Open to Angular, but this would undermine the main 'Only Microsoft' goal 
    - Backend: ASP.Core Core API 
    - Database: 
        This depends on the architecture approach and what would be feasable
        - Azure Cosmos DB 
            * tentant would be to learn noSQL db
